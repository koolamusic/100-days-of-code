4. **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
5. Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) and [Log](log.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7. **Optionally Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
8. Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9. Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
